### Introduction
This paper aims to identify the variables that best predict GPA based on the dataset collected and given. Using a random subset of 200 samples, I interpreted predictive models using variables such as sleep quality, cognitive ability, stress levels, and other lifestyle factors. I used a variety of methods but focused on forward selection and backward elimination to identify the most significant predictors.

 ### Exploratory Data Analysis
 I initially started by creating scatterplots and getting their correlation coefficients to assess the linear relationships between GPA and each of the given predictor variables.[Figures 1-11]. However, this was not very helpful as all of the correlations were weak, with the highest coefficient being 0.1676 for CognitionZScore. I then conducted t-tests for each variable to try to determine the potential significance of the model [Figures 12-22]. All of the variables had a p-value below the 0.05 threshold, suggesting that they all had some potential significance and relation to GPA. I then tried to look at the residual and QQ plots for each variable [Figures 23-44] to determine if a linear model was not appropriate and if any transformations were necessary. In this process, preliminary single-predictor models showed some heteroscedasticity and non-normality for some variables- ClassesMissed [Figures 23-24], PoorSleepQuality [Figures 27-28], AnxietyScore [Figures 31-32], Drinks, [Figures 39-40], and WeekdaySleep [Figures 43-44]. I then did Box-Cox transformations for these variables [Figures 45-49] to determine if there was a linear relationship after the transformation, but the multiple R-squared values, p-values, and other statistical values (the R-squared values, p-values, and others) were inconclusive and did not suggest that any one predictor variable had a significant effect.
